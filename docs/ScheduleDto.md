# ScheduleDto

The backup schedule of a portal.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**storageType** | [**BackupStorageType**](BackupStorageType.md) | The storage the scheduled archives are written to, reported as a number rather than as the name the  schedule was created with. | [default to undefined]
**storageParams** | **{ [key: string]: string | null; }** | The settings of the storage, as an object keyed by parameter name - not as the array of key and value  pairs the schedule was created with, so it cannot be sent back unchanged. For every storage type  except `ThirdPartyConsumer` the `folderId` key is built from the stored base path. | [default to undefined]
**cronParams** | [**CronParamsDto**](CronParamsDto.md) | When the backup runs, read back from the stored cron expression. `day` is 0 for a daily schedule,  because a daily one has no day. | [default to undefined]
**backupsStored** | **number** | The number of scheduled copies kept. It is null, not 0, when the schedule keeps an unlimited number. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**lastBackupTime** | **string** | The date and time the schedule last ran at. It is `0001-01-01T00:00:00` until the schedule has run  for the first time. | [default to undefined]
**dump** | **boolean** | Specifies whether this schedule backs up the whole server instead of one portal. | [default to undefined]
