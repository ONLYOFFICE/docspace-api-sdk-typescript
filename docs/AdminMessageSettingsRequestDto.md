# AdminMessageSettingsRequestDto

The message sent to the portal administrators, with the CAPTCHA proof that a person wrote it.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**message** | **string** | What the sender wants to tell the portal administrators. Markup is stripped before the letter is written, so  a body that carries nothing but markup counts as empty and is refused with 400. | [default to undefined]
**email** | **string** | The address the sender can be answered at, which the letter is signed with. It has to be a well-formed email  address. | [default to undefined]
**culture** | **string** | The language the letter is written in, as a culture name such as `en-US`. A culture the installation does not  have falls back to the portal language rather than failing the call. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**recaptchaType** | [**RecaptchaType**](RecaptchaType.md) | Which CAPTCHA service the proof in `recaptchaResponse` came from. It has to match the service the  installation is configured with, which `GET api/2.0/capabilities` reports; the default value means the  installation is left to decide. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**recaptchaResponse** | **string** | The token the CAPTCHA widget produced in the browser, passed on unchanged for the portal to verify with the  CAPTCHA service. It is single-use and short-lived, so it cannot be reused for a second message. | [optional] [default to undefined]
