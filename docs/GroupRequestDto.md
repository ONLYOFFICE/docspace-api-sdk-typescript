# GroupRequestDto

The group request parameters.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**members** | **Array&lt;string&gt;** | The accounts to put into the new group. Every one of them has to be an active member that is not a guest,  otherwise the whole call is rejected. Omit it to create an empty group. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**groupManager** | **string** | The account to make the manager of the new group. It is added to the group as well, so it does not have to be  repeated in `members`. Omit it to create a group without a manager. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**groupName** | **string** | The name of the group, from 1 to 128 characters. It is required, it may not be blank, and it does not have to  be unique. | [default to undefined]
