# BackupHistoryRecord

One stored backup of a portal.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **string** | The ID of the backup, which is the same value as the `taskId` the backup was started with. Pass it to  `DELETE api/2.0/backup/deletebackup/{id}` or as the `backupId` of  `POST api/2.0/backup/startrestore`. | [default to undefined]
**fileName** | **string** | The name of the stored archive. It is built from the portal alias and the moment the backup started,  or from `workspace` instead of the alias for a backup of the whole server. | [default to undefined]
**storageType** | [**BackupStorageType**](BackupStorageType.md) | The storage the archive was written to, reported as a number rather than as a name. | [default to undefined]
**createdOn** | **string** | The date and time the backup was stored at, in UTC. | [default to undefined]
**expiresOn** | **string** | The date and time a background cleaner removes this backup at. Only a backup written to `DataStore`  expires, one day after it was stored; for every other storage type this is `0001-01-01T00:00:00`,  which means the backup is kept until it is deleted by hand or pushed out by the stored-copies limit  of a schedule. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { BackupHistoryRecord } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: BackupHistoryRecord = {
    id,
    fileName,
    storageType,
    createdOn,
    expiresOn,
};
