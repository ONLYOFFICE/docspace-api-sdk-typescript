# ChangeWalletServiceStateRequestDto

Which wallet service is switched, and which way.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**service** | [**TenantWalletService**](TenantWalletService.md) | The service being switched, given by its catalogue name. Switching it on only makes it available to the  portal; its units are still bought with `PUT api/2.0/portal/payment/updatewallet`. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**enabled** | **boolean** | Which way the service is switched: `true` makes it available to the portal, `false` withdraws it. Setting the  state the service already has changes nothing. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { ChangeWalletServiceStateRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: ChangeWalletServiceStateRequestDto = {
    service,
    enabled,
};
```
