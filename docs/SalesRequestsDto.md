# SalesRequestsDto

Who is writing to the ONLYOFFICE sales team, and what about.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**userName** | **string** | The name the sales team should address the reply to. It is sent as written and is not matched against any  portal account; an empty value fails the request with 400. | [default to undefined]
**email** | **string** | The address the answer is sent to. It has to be a well-formed email address and need not be the caller portal  address; an empty or malformed value fails the request with 400. | [default to undefined]
**message** | **string** | What is being asked of the sales team - a quote, an invoice, or a plan that cannot be bought online. An empty  value fails the request with 400. | [default to undefined]
