# FormResultsDto

One completed copy of a form, with the values that were entered into it.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**createOn** | **string** | When the portal recorded this copy, in UTC: the moment the filled copy was completed and its data indexed, not  the moment the form itself was made. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**formsData** | [**Array&lt;FormsItemData&gt;**](FormsItemData.md) | The values that were entered into this copy, one entry per field, preceded by an entry keyed `FormNumber` that  carries the number of the copy and is what the submissions are ordered by. Fields holding a picture or a  signature are left out of the record, so a field missing here was not necessarily left blank. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { FormResultsDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: FormResultsDto = {
    createOn,
    formsData,
};
