# AuthServiceDto

One third-party authorization or storage provider and the keys the portal connects to it with.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **string** | The internal key of the provider, such as `google` or `box`. It is the `name` that  `POST api/2.0/settings/authservice` takes to select the provider. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**title** | **string** | The provider name as it is shown in the interface. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**description** | **string** | A sentence about what connecting the provider gives the portal, shown next to it in the interface. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**instruction** | **string** | The steps an administrator has to take on the provider side to obtain the keys, shown in the interface. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**canSet** | **boolean** | Whether this provider accepts keys through the API at all. A provider whose keys are fixed by the  installation reports `false`, and saving keys for it is refused. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**paid** | **boolean** | Whether the provider is a paid option. A paid one can only be connected while the portal plan includes  third-party storage or the installation is licensed as self-hosted. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**props** | [**Array&lt;AuthKeyDto&gt;**](AuthKeyDto.md) | The keys the provider defines, with the values last saved and how the settings form shows each of them.  It is `null` for a provider that forbids changes (`canSet` is `false`): its keys are not read at all. | [optional] [default to undefined]
