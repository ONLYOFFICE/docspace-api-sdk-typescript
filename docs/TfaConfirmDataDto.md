# TfaConfirmDataDto

The confirmation link the caller has to follow to pass the two-factor step, and the cookie it depends on.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**url** | **string** | The link to open. Its `type` shows which step it is: phone activation or phone authorization for the SMS  method, and authenticator activation or re-verification for the application method. The whole body is empty  when the portal requires no second factor of the caller. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**cookieName** | **string** | The name of the confirmation cookie the link is validated against. It is filled in only for the  authenticator-application method; the SMS method returns `url` alone. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**cookieValue** | **string** | The value of that cookie. The call already set it on the response, so it is repeated here only for a client  that does not keep cookies of its own; it is filled in under the same condition as `cookieName`, and a  later call to this operation replaces it. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { TfaConfirmDataDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: TfaConfirmDataDto = {
    url,
    cookieName,
    cookieValue,
};
```
