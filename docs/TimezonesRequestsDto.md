# TimezonesRequestsDto

One time zone the host offers, as its identifier and the label to show for it.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **string** | The IANA identifier of the time zone. This is the value the portal time zone is set to, so pass it on  unchanged to `PUT api/2.0/settings/timeandlanguage`. | [default to undefined]
**displayName** | **string** | The label to show for the zone, carrying its UTC offset as it stood when the list was built. The offset is a  snapshot rather than a rule, so a zone observing daylight saving reads differently at other times of the  year; sort and match on `id` instead. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { TimezonesRequestsDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: TimezonesRequestsDto = {
    id,
    displayName,
};
```
