# SsoSettingsRequestsDto

The whole SAML Single Sign-On configuration of the portal, carried as a serialised JSON object.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**serializeSettings** | **string** | The configuration object serialised to a JSON string, not a nested object. It is the complete configuration  rather than a patch - fields left out are stored empty - so start from `GET api/2.0/settings/ssov2` or  `GET api/2.0/settings/ssov2/default` and send back a changed copy. The identity provider entity ID and  sign-in URL are required, the sign-in and sign-out URLs have to be absolute `http` or `https` addresses, and  the attribute mapping has to name the first name, last name and email fields; the values each SAML field  accepts are listed by `GET api/2.0/settings/ssov2/constants`. An empty string, or a string that carries no  configuration object, is refused with 400. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { SsoSettingsRequestsDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: SsoSettingsRequestsDto = {
    serializeSettings,
};
```
