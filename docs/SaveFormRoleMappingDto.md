# SaveFormRoleMappingDto

The people who are to fill in the roles of a PDF form.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**formId** | **number** | The PDF form the roles belong to. This is the value the operation reads, rather than the identifier in its  route, and the two are to be sent the same. | [default to undefined]
**roles** | [**Array&lt;FormRoleRequest&gt;**](FormRoleRequest.md) | The roles with the account taking each of them and the sequence number that decides the turn: the same number  means the roles may be filled in parallel, different ones make a queue. The whole set is replaced on every  call, and an empty set resets the filling. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { SaveFormRoleMappingDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: SaveFormRoleMappingDto = {
    formId,
    roles,
};
```
