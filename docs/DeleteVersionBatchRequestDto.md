# DeleteVersionBatchRequestDto

The file whose versions are deleted, and the versions to delete.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**returnSingleOperation** | **boolean** | Which operations the answer carries: `true` returns the operation this call started and nothing else, `false`  returns every operation of the same kind that the caller has running or unread. When nothing was queued, which  happens for an empty selection, `true` falls back to the full list. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**deleteAfter** | **boolean** | Whether the finished operation is still reported: `false` keeps its final record readable through  `GET api/2.0/files/fileops` until it has been read once, `true` drops the record as soon as the work is done.  It does not postpone the deletion and does not delete anything of its own. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**fileId** | **number** | The file whose history the versions are taken from; only files stored in the portal itself are addressed here. | [default to undefined]
**versions** | **Array&lt;number&gt;** | The version numbers to remove, as reported by `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/history`. At least one number  has to be sent: an empty list removes the file itself instead of one of its versions. The number of the  current version is refused outright, while a number that no longer exists is passed over without a complaint. | [default to undefined]
