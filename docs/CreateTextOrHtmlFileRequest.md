# CreateTextOrHtmlFileRequest

The parameters of a text or HTML file created from content sent in the request.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**title** | **string** | The title of the file. The extension the operation stands for is appended unless the title already ends with  it, so Notes becomes Notes.txt or Notes.html. | [default to undefined]
**content** | **string** | The content of the file, as plain text or as HTML markup. A request carrying none is rejected as an invalid  request, and for a text file content that looks like markup makes the portal store it as HTML instead. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**createNewIfExist** | **boolean** | What to do when the folder already holds a file of this title, the other way round than the name reads: `true`  updates that file and adds a version to its history, `false` creates another file and makes its title unique,  as in Notes (1).txt. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { CreateTextOrHtmlFileRequest } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: CreateTextOrHtmlFileRequest = {
    title,
    content,
    createNewIfExist,
};
```
