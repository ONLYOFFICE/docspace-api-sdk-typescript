# QuantityRequestDto

The new size of the portal subscription.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**quantity** | **{ [key: string]: number; }** | The plan and the number of units it is to cover, as a single pair. While the portal is on a priced plan the  key has to be the `name` of that same plan, which `GET api/2.0/portal/payment/quota` reports, because the  subscription is resized rather than swapped; the value is the total the subscription is to have afterwards,  not the difference. Exactly one pair is accepted, and a value that is already in effect is refused with 400. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { QuantityRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: QuantityRequestDto = {
    quantity,
};
```
