# TfaSettingsDto

One two-factor authentication method the portal offers, with the portal-wide state of that method.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **string** | Which method this entry describes: `sms` for a code sent by text message, `app` for a code from an  authenticator application. It is the value `PUT api/2.0/settings/tfaapp` takes as its `type`, and no other  value ever appears here. | [default to undefined]
**title** | **string** | The label for the method in the portal language, meant for a button or a radio option. It is not stable  enough to branch on - match `id` for that. | [default to undefined]
**enabled** | **boolean** | Whether this method is the portal\'s current policy. At most one entry can have it set, and none has it  while the portal challenges nobody. It says nothing about the caller\'s own account, which may be exempt  through `trustedIps` or forced through `mandatoryUsers`. | [default to undefined]
**available** | **boolean** | Whether the method could be switched on at all. For `sms` it is `false` until the installation has a  working SMS provider, so a method can be offered here and still be impossible to enable; for `app` it is  always `true`. | [default to undefined]
**trustedIps** | **Array&lt;string&gt;** | The addresses that skip the challenge, each either a single address, a `from-to` pair or a CIDR range. It  is empty when no address is exempt, which means every account is challenged. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**mandatoryUsers** | **Array&lt;string&gt;** | The accounts that are challenged even from a trusted address, by user ID. Empty means the exemption in  `trustedIps` holds for everyone. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**mandatoryGroups** | **Array&lt;string&gt;** | The groups whose members are challenged even from a trusted address, by group ID, with the same reading of  an empty list as `mandatoryUsers`. | [optional] [default to undefined]
