# BackupProgress

The state of one backup or restoring job.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**isCompleted** | **boolean** | Specifies whether the job has stopped running. This is the field to poll: true means the job will not  change any more, whether it succeeded, failed or was cancelled, and `status` tells which of the three  it is. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**progress** | **number** | The share of the job that is already done, from 0 to 100. A job that has only been queued reports 0,  because the work starts when a separate worker service picks it up. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**error** | **string** | The message of the error that stopped the job. It is an empty string, not null, while the job runs  and after a job that succeeded, so the sign of a failure is a non-empty value - and this is the only  place where the reason is reported. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**warning** | **string** | A message about a job that stopped without failing: it names the entry inside the archive that lists  the files which could not be read, when a backup finished without some of them, and it says so when  the job was cancelled. It is an empty string otherwise, and it is only ever filled in for a backup  job - a cancelled restoring job leaves it empty. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**link** | **string** | The link to download the stored archive. It is an empty string until the archive has been uploaded,  and it is only ever filled in for a backup job, never for a restoring one. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**tenantId** | **number** | The ID of the portal the job belongs to, or -1 for a job that covers the whole server. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**backupProgressEnum** | [**BackupProgressEnum**](BackupProgressEnum.md) | Whether this is a backup or a restoring job, reported as a number rather than as a name. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**status** | [**DistributedTaskStatus**](DistributedTaskStatus.md) | The state of the job: `Created` while it waits for a worker to pick it up, `Running` while it works,  `Completed` once it has finished on its own, `Canceled` after it was cancelled, and `Failted` when it  stopped on an error, in which case `error` carries the reason. Reported as a number rather than as a  name. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**taskId** | **string** | The ID of the job. It is the handle to poll this operation with, and for a backup job it also becomes  the `id` of the record in `GET api/2.0/backup/getbackuphistory`. | [optional] [default to undefined]
