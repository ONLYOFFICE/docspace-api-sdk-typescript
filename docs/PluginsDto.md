# PluginsDto

What the installation allows to be done with web plugins.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**enabled** | **boolean** | Whether web plugins run on this portal at all. While it is `false` the operations under  `api/2.0/settings/webplugins` are of no use, whatever the other two flags say. All three are `false`  unless the installation switched plugins on in its configuration. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**upload** | **boolean** | Whether an administrator may add a plugin of their own through  `POST api/2.0/settings/webplugins`. While it is `false` only the plugins that ship with the installation  are available. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**_delete** | **boolean** | Whether an added plugin may be removed again through `DELETE api/2.0/settings/webplugins/{name}`. The  plugins that ship with the installation cannot be removed regardless of this flag. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { PluginsDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: PluginsDto = {
    enabled,
    upload,
    _delete,
};
