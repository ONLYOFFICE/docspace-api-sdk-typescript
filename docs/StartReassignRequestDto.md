# StartReassignRequestDto

The request parameters for starting the reassignment process.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**fromUserId** | **string** | The ID of the user whose rooms and shared files are transferred away. The account has to have the `Terminated`  status already, and it cannot be a system account, the portal owner or the caller. | [default to undefined]
**toUserId** | **string** | The ID of the user who receives the data. The account has to be an active room admin or DocSpace admin, so a  guest, a system account or a disabled account is rejected. | [default to undefined]
**deleteProfile** | **boolean** | Specifies whether to delete the source profile once the transfer succeeds. When false, which is the default,  the emptied profile is kept and can be deleted later through `DELETE api/2.0/people/{userid}`. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { StartReassignRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';
