# **getSpaceUsageStatistics**
> UsageSpaceStatItemArrayWrapper getSpaceUsageStatistics()

Returns the storage space used by one portal module, broken down per data category the module tracks (for  example per room type), together with a human-readable size and whether the category is disabled. Requires  Owner or DocSpaceAdmin (the EditPortalSettings permission). `id` identifies the module by the same GUID the  portal\'s module catalog uses; a module that does not exist, or one that does not report space usage at all,  returns an empty list rather than an error. This is a read-only, idempotent call, and the list is not  paginated. Sizes are already formatted as display strings (for example `1.5 GB`), not raw byte counts.
