# AdditionalWhiteLabelSettingsDto

Which of the ONLYOFFICE help and community entries the interface may offer, installation-wide.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**startDocsEnabled** | **boolean** | Whether the sample documents that ONLYOFFICE ships may be placed in a new user\'s Documents. Unlike the link  flags below it depends on nothing that has to be configured, so its built-in value is always `true`. | [default to undefined]
**helpCenterEnabled** | **boolean** | Whether the interface may offer the Help Center entry. It is `false` both when the entry was switched off  for the installation and when the installation configures no Help Center address at all; the addresses  themselves are not part of this answer and arrive in `externalResources` of `GET api/2.0/settings`. | [default to undefined]
**feedbackAndSupportEnabled** | **boolean** | Whether the interface may offer the Feedback and Support entry, `false` for the same two reasons as  `helpCenterEnabled`. | [default to undefined]
**userForumEnabled** | **boolean** | Whether the interface may offer the user forum entry, `false` for the same two reasons as  `helpCenterEnabled`. | [default to undefined]
**videoGuidesEnabled** | **boolean** | Whether the interface may offer the Video Guides entry, `false` for the same two reasons as  `helpCenterEnabled`. | [default to undefined]
**licenseAgreementsEnabled** | **boolean** | Whether the interface may offer the License Agreements entry, `false` for the same two reasons as  `helpCenterEnabled`. | [default to undefined]
**isDefault** | **boolean** | Whether all six flags still hold the values the installation starts out with. It turns `false` as soon as  one of them is saved differently and `true` again after `DELETE api/2.0/settings/rebranding/additional`.  Because a link flag starts out off when no address is configured for it, `true` does not mean every entry  is on. | [default to undefined]
