# SessionRequest

The file a chunked upload session is opened for, and how a clash with an existing name is settled.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**fileName** | **string** | The name to store the file under, extension included. Characters a title cannot hold are replaced and the name  is truncated, so the stored title can differ from the one sent. | [default to undefined]
**fileSize** | **number** | The exact number of bytes that will be sent. The size is reserved when the session opens and compared with the  parts as they arrive; below the portal chunk size the session takes the whole payload in one part, and above  the portal limit for chunked uploads it is refused. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**relativePath** | **string** | A slash-separated chain of folder titles under the target folder to store the file in; folders in the chain  that do not exist yet are created. Leave it empty to store the file in the folder from the path itself. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**createOn** | [**ApiDateTime**](ApiDateTime.md) | The creation time to stamp on a newly created file instead of the moment the upload finishes. It is ignored  when the upload lands on a file that already exists. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**encrypted** | **boolean** | Marks the stored file as client-side encrypted, which is how content uploaded into a private room is kept;  with false the bytes are stored as they arrive. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**createNewIfExist** | **boolean** | Settles the clash when the folder already holds a file with this name: true stores the upload beside it under  a name with a numeric suffix, false takes the existing file over and adds the content to it as a new version. | [optional] [default to undefined]
