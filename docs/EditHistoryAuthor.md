# EditHistoryAuthor

The person a saved revision of a file, or one single change in it, is attributed to.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **string** | The account the revision or the change is attributed to, as the editing service stored it. It is normally the  identifier of a portal account; the empty identifier stands for a change nobody could be named for. | [default to undefined]
**name** | **string** | The display name of that account as the portal spells it now, which need not be the name that was stored with  the revision. An account that cannot be resolved - one removed from the portal, or a change made through an  anonymous link - is reported as a guest. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { EditHistoryAuthor } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: EditHistoryAuthor = {
    id,
    name,
};
```
