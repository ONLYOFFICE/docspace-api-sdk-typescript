# DeepLinkDto

What a mobile client needs to hand a portal link to the installed application instead of the browser.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**androidPackageName** | **string** | The package name to look for on Android, and to build a store link from when the application is missing.  All three fields are empty strings on an installation that ships no mobile application, which is the  signal to keep opening links in the browser. | [default to undefined]
**url** | **string** | The address the client redirects a portal link through so that the application can claim it. It is the  installation\'s own deep-link host, not a link to any particular document. | [default to undefined]
**iosPackageId** | **string** | The bundle identifier to look for on iOS, used the same way as `androidPackageName`. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { DeepLinkDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: DeepLinkDto = {
    androidPackageName,
    url,
    iosPackageId,
};
```
