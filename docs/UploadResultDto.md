# UploadResultDto

The outcome of storing an image in temporary storage before it is used as a room logo.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**success** | **boolean** | True when the image was stored and its path is in the data field. A rejected image is reported with an error  response rather than with a false here, so this field is true in every answer that carries a body. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**data** | **any** |  | [optional] [default to undefined]
**message** | **string** | Left empty by this operation: nothing is reported here, and a refused image comes back as an error response  instead. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { UploadResultDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: UploadResultDto = {
    success,
    data,
    message,
};
```
