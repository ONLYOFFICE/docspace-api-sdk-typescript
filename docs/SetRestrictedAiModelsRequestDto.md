# SetRestrictedAiModelsRequestDto

The complete set of AI chat models that are to be barred on the portal.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**models** | **Set&lt;string&gt;** | The identifiers of the models no user of the portal may pick, taken from  `GET api/2.0/portal/payment/ai-prices`. This is the whole set that is to hold afterwards and not a list of  additions: send the models already barred together with the new one to add a restriction, leave one out to  lift it, and send an empty set to lift them all. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { SetRestrictedAiModelsRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: SetRestrictedAiModelsRequestDto = {
    models,
};
```
