# PriceDto

What a quota costs, and the currency that amount is in.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**value** | **number** | The amount for one billing period, per unit for a quota sold by the unit. It is empty for a quota that is  not sold for money - the free, trial and non-profit ones - and for a quota this installation has no price  list entry for. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**currencySymbol** | **string** | The symbol to print in front of `value`, such as `$`. It is chosen for the currency, not for the portal  language, so it is not a localised format. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**isoCurrencySymbol** | **string** | The currency as a three-letter ISO 4217 code, which is the value to compare on when `currencySymbol` is  ambiguous between currencies that share a sign. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { PriceDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: PriceDto = {
    value,
    currencySymbol,
    isoCurrencySymbol,
};
```
