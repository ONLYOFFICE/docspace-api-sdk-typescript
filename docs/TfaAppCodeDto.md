# TfaAppCodeDto

One backup code of the caller\'s authenticator credential.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**isUsed** | **boolean** | Whether the code has already been spent. A spent code is kept in the list but is no longer accepted, so  count the entries where this is `false` to know how many fallbacks remain. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**code** | **string** | The code itself, in the form it is typed at sign-in - six characters with the default configuration. It is  stored encrypted and decrypted for this answer, so this is the one place a caller can read it. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { TfaAppCodeDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: TfaAppCodeDto = {
    isUsed,
    code,
};
```
