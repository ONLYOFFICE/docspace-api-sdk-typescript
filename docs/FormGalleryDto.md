# FormGalleryDto

Where the ready-made form templates are served from, for browsing them and for submitting new ones.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**path** | **string** | The path under `domain` that the gallery\'s own listing API is reached at. It is joined to `domain` by the  client; the portal only relays the values from its configuration. | [default to undefined]
**domain** | **string** | The address of the gallery service, which is a service of the vendor rather than part of the portal. Every  field of this object is empty on an installation that configures no gallery, and a client should then not  offer the gallery at all. | [default to undefined]
**ext** | **string** | The file extension to ask the gallery for, which decides which rendition of a template is downloaded when  several are published. | [default to undefined]
**uploadPath** | **string** | The path used for submitting a form of one\'s own to the gallery, the counterpart of `path` for the upload  side. The four `upload` fields are empty when the installation allows browsing but not submitting. | [default to undefined]
**uploadDomain** | **string** | The address the submission is sent to, which may differ from `domain`. | [default to undefined]
**uploadExt** | **string** | The file extension a submitted form has to carry. | [default to undefined]
**uploadDashboard** | **string** | The page a person is sent to in order to follow up on a submission, joined to `uploadDomain` the same way  as `uploadPath`. | [default to undefined]
