# WebItemSecurityRequestDto

The access rule stored for one portal module: whether it may be opened, and by whom.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **string** | The module the rule applies to, given as a GUID. A value that is not a GUID fails the request as invalid. | [default to undefined]
**enabled** | **boolean** | Whether the module may be opened. It decides the outcome only while `subjects` names somebody: an empty  `subjects` array is stored as access for everyone whatever this flag says. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**subjects** | **Array&lt;string&gt;** | The users and groups the rule is stored for, given by their IDs. This is the whole allow-list that is to hold  afterwards and not a list of additions - what was stored before is dropped. Leaving it out applies `enabled`  to everyone and skips the audit trail entry, while sending it empty stores access for everyone. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { WebItemSecurityRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: WebItemSecurityRequestDto = {
    id,
    enabled,
    subjects,
};
```
