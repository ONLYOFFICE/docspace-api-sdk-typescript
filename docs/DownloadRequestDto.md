# DownloadRequestDto

The files and folders to pack into one archive, together with the formats they are converted to.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**returnSingleOperation** | **boolean** | Which operations the answer carries: `true` returns the operation this call started and nothing else, `false`  returns every operation of the same kind that the caller has running or unread. When nothing was queued, which  happens for an empty selection, `true` falls back to the full list. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**folderIds** | [**Array&lt;DownloadRequestDtoAllOfFolderIds&gt;**](DownloadRequestDtoAllOfFolderIds.md) | The folders to pack, by id; everything inside them that the caller may read goes into the archive. A number  addresses a folder stored in the portal itself, a string addresses a folder on a connected third-party  account, and both kinds may be sent in one list. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**fileIds** | [**Array&lt;DownloadRequestDtoAllOfFileIds&gt;**](DownloadRequestDtoAllOfFileIds.md) | The files to pack as they are, by id, without conversion. A number addresses a file stored in the portal  itself, a string addresses a file on a connected third-party account, and both kinds may be sent in one list. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**fileConvertIds** | [**Array&lt;DownloadRequestItemDto&gt;**](DownloadRequestItemDto.md) | The files to convert before they are packed, each named together with the format it is converted to. A file  listed here does not have to be repeated in `fileIds`. | [optional] [default to undefined]
