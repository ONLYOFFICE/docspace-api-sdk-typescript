# ChangeOwnerRequestDto

The rooms and files to hand over, together with the account that takes them.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**folderIds** | [**Array&lt;BatchRequestDtoAllOfFileIds&gt;**](BatchRequestDtoAllOfFileIds.md) | The rooms to hand over, identified as `GET api/2.0/files/rooms` returns them - a number for a room stored on  the portal and a string for one that lives on a connected third-party account. Only rooms belong here; a  folder inside a room is refused. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**fileIds** | [**Array&lt;BatchRequestDtoAllOfFileIds&gt;**](BatchRequestDtoAllOfFileIds.md) | The files to hand over, identified as a listing operation returns them - a number for a file stored on the  portal and a string for one on a connected third-party account. Only a file kept in the portal\'s common  section is accepted. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**userId** | **string** | The account that becomes the owner of every listed entry. It has to be an active member allowed to manage  rooms, so a deactivated account, a guest or a plain member is rejected, and for a private room the account  must have set up its encryption keys beforehand. | [default to undefined]
