# CspDto

The Content Security Policy of the portal: the domains an administrator allowed, and the header built from them.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**domains** | **Array&lt;string&gt;** | The external hosts an administrator has allowed, each in the form it was saved in - a bare host, a host  with a scheme, or a wildcard such as `*.example.com`. An empty list means nobody has added one, not that  the portal serves no policy. | [default to undefined]
**header** | **string** | The complete policy value the portal sends to browsers, assembled from `domains` together with the  portal\'s own sources and the integrations it has switched on. It is therefore wider than `domains` alone,  and is filled in even while that list is empty. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { CspDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: CspDto = {
    domains,
    header,
};
```
