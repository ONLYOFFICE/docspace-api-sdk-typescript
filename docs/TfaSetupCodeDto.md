# TfaSetupCodeDto

The secret to enrol in an authenticator application, in both of the forms an application can take it.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**account** | **string** | The label the authenticator application will list the credential under, which is the caller\'s own email  address. It identifies the entry to a person, and no application checks it. | [optional] [readonly] [default to undefined]
**manualEntryKey** | **string** | The secret in the base32 form that is typed into an application by hand. It describes the very same  credential as `qrCodeSetupImageUrl`, and repeating the call hands back the same value for the account until  the credential is reset. | [optional] [readonly] [default to undefined]
**qrCodeSetupImageUrl** | **string** | The same secret as a scannable image, given as a `data:image/png;base64,` URL that can be rendered  directly - it is not a link to fetch. | [optional] [readonly] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { TfaSetupCodeDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: TfaSetupCodeDto = {
    account,
    manualEntryKey,
    qrCodeSetupImageUrl,
};
