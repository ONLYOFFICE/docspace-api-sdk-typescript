# HideConfirmConvertRequestDto

The body of the conversion prompt switch: which of the two prompts to hide.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**save** | **boolean** | Chooses the prompt to hide rather than the state to store: true hides the prompt that offers to keep a copy in  the original format when a document is converted, false hides the prompt that offers to open the conversion  result. Each of the two flags is stored separately for the calling account, and both are one-way - the portal  can hide a prompt but has no way to show it again. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { HideConfirmConvertRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: HideConfirmConvertRequestDto = {
    save,
};
```
