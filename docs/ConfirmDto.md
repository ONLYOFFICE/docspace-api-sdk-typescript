# ConfirmDto

Whether a confirmation link may still be used, and what it leads to when it invites into a room.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**result** | [**ValidationResult**](ValidationResult.md) | The outcome of the check. Only `Ok` means the action behind the link may be carried out: `Invalid` and  `Expired` fault the key itself, while `UserExisted`, `UserExcluded`, `TariffLimit` and `QuotaFailed` mean  the key is sound but the invitation behind it cannot be accepted as it stands. | [default to undefined]
**roomId** | **string** | The room the invitation leads into - a numeric folder ID for a room of the portal, a provider-specific  string for a third-party one. It is empty for an invitation to the portal as a whole, for a room that has  been removed or that the invited account may not see, and whenever `result` is neither `Ok` nor  `UserExisted`. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**title** | **string** | The title of that room, present exactly when `roomId` is and meant to be shown on the confirmation page. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**email** | **string** | The address the link was issued for, echoed back only when `result` is `Ok` so that a sign-up form can be  prefilled with it. Every other outcome leaves it empty, `UserExisted` included. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**isAgent** | **boolean** | Whether the room behind the link is an AI room rather than an ordinary one, which decides where the invited  person is taken. It is `false` whenever `roomId` is empty. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { ConfirmDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

    email,
