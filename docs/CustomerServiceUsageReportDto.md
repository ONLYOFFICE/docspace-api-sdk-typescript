# CustomerServiceUsageReportDto

One page of the per-service consumption totals, with the paging figures needed to walk the rest.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**collection** | [**Array&lt;CustomerServiceUsageDto&gt;**](CustomerServiceUsageDto.md) | The services on this page, one entry per service rather than per charge. It is empty for a period in  which nothing was consumed as well as for a page past the end of the report. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**offset** | **number** | How many entries were skipped before this page, echoed from the request. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**limit** | **number** | How many entries one page may hold, echoed from the request; it is 25 unless another value was asked for. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**totalQuantity** | **number** | How many services match the filters in total, across every page - services, not charges. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**totalPage** | **number** | How many pages those entries come to at the current `limit`. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**currentPage** | **number** | Which of those pages this one is, as the billing service numbers them. Page through by advancing `offset`  rather than this value, which nothing accepts as an argument. | [optional] [default to undefined]
