# MailDomainSettingsRequestDto

Which email domains the portal treats as already verified, and how their users join.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | [**TenantTrustedDomainsType**](TenantTrustedDomainsType.md) | How trusted domains are decided: no domain is trusted, every domain is, or only the ones listed in `domains`.  Only the custom mode reads `domains`; under the other two the list is ignored rather than refused. | [default to undefined]
**domains** | **Array&lt;string&gt;** | The trusted domains, as bare hostnames such as `example.com` without a scheme or an `@`. This is the whole  list that is to hold afterwards and not a list of additions. Each entry is lowercased before it is stored,  and one entry that is not a valid hostname - or an empty list in the custom mode - fails the whole call  without saving anything. | [default to undefined]
**inviteUsersAsVisitors** | **boolean** | What a user joining through a trusted domain becomes: `true` admits them as a guest, `false` as a full  member. It applies to joins made from now on and does not change anybody who has already joined. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { MailDomainSettingsRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: MailDomainSettingsRequestDto = {
    type,
    domains,
    inviteUsersAsVisitors,
};
```
