# GreetingSettingsRequestDto

The greeting caption the portal shows its users.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**title** | **string** | The caption to store, which is kept as the portal name. An empty value clears the greeting and returns the  portal to the built-in default caption. On a cloud portal with a free or trial plan the text is also matched  against the character rule configured for the installation and a text that breaks it is refused, while a paid  cloud plan and a self-hosted installation apply no such check. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { GreetingSettingsRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: GreetingSettingsRequestDto = {
    title,
};
```
