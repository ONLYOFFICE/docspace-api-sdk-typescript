# WebItemsSecurityRequestDto

The modules switched on or off together, one entry per module.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**items** | [**Array&lt;ItemKeyValuePairStringBoolean&gt;**](ItemKeyValuePairStringBoolean.md) | The modules to switch, each entry pairing a module GUID as its `key` with the new enabled flag as its  `value`. A key that is not a GUID fails the whole request as invalid, and a module listed twice is applied  once, from its first entry. No allow-list travels here: switching a product module on restores the users and  groups it was last restricted to, and everything else is stored as a plain allow or deny for everyone. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { WebItemsSecurityRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: WebItemsSecurityRequestDto = {
    items,
};
```
