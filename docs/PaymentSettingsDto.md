# PaymentSettingsDto

Where to buy or extend the portal\'s subscription, and what the subscription in force looks like.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**salesEmail** | **string** | The vendor mailbox to write to about buying, extending or changing the subscription, picked for the portal  language. It is not the portal\'s own support address. | [default to undefined]
**feedbackAndSupportUrl** | **string** | Not populated: nothing fills this field in, so it always comes back empty. The help and support addresses  live in `externalResources` of `GET api/2.0/settings` instead. | [optional] [default to undefined]
**buyUrl** | **string** | The vendor page for buying or extending the subscription, chosen for the licence kind the installation was  built for and for the portal language. It is a page for a person to open, not an API to call. | [default to undefined]
**standalone** | **boolean** | Whether this is a server installation someone administers themselves rather than a portal in the cloud,  which decides whether payment means uploading a licence file or a subscription in the vendor\'s store. | [default to undefined]
**currentLicense** | [**CurrentLicenseInfo**](CurrentLicenseInfo.md) | The subscription in force, reduced to the two facts a payment page needs. | [default to undefined]
**max** | **number** | The largest quantity of a paid item - members, storage - that may be bought in one go, `999` unless the  installation configures another cap. It bounds a single purchase, not the total a portal may hold. | [default to undefined]
