# SettingsRequestDto

The body of a file settings switch: a single flag carrying the state to store.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**set** | **boolean** | The state to store for the setting the operation addresses: true switches it on, false switches it off. The  flag carries no meaning of its own - what is switched, who is allowed to switch it, and whether the value  belongs to the calling account or to the whole portal are stated by the operation that binds this body. The  answer repeats the value the portal read back afterwards, which is not always the one that was sent. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { SettingsRequestDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: SettingsRequestDto = {
    set,
};
```
