# RoomGroupRequestDto

The name, the icon and the rooms of a room group to create.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **string** | The name to show the group under. Surrounding spaces are trimmed before it is stored, a name that is blank  once trimmed is refused, and the name does not have to differ from the names of the caller\'s other groups. | [default to undefined]
**icon** | **string** | The icon of the group, given as the identifier of one of the built-in covers listed by  `GET api/2.0/files/rooms/covers`. An uploaded image cannot be used, and any value that is not one of those  identifiers is refused. | [default to undefined]
**rooms** | [**Array&lt;DuplicateRequestDtoAllOfFileIds&gt;**](DuplicateRequestDtoAllOfFileIds.md) | The rooms to gather in the group, each given as a number for a room stored in the portal or as a string for a  room on a connected third-party account. Every identifier has to name a room the caller can read; repeats are  collapsed, and an element of any other shape - a decimal number, a number sent as a string, null - is refused. | [default to undefined]
**searchArea** | [**SearchArea**](SearchArea.md) | The section the group belongs to: Active for Rooms and Forms for Forms. Active when omitted. | [optional] [default to undefined]
