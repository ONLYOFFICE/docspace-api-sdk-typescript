# ActiveConnectionsDto

The connections the calling user currently has open, and which of them the request itself was made with.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**loginEvent** | **number** | The `id` of the item in `items` that the current request is authenticated by. It is `0` when the request  carried a token in the `Authorization` header instead of the portal cookie, and in that case none of the  items is the current connection. | [default to undefined]
**items** | [**Array&lt;ActiveConnectionsItemDto&gt;**](ActiveConnectionsItemDto.md) | One item per sign-in of the caller that is still active, ordered newest sign-in first, with the connection  the request itself uses moved to the front. Sign-ins older than a year are left out, and a caller with no  stored connection gets a single item describing the current request rather than an empty list. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { ActiveConnectionsDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: ActiveConnectionsDto = {
    loginEvent,
    items,
};
