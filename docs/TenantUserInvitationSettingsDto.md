# TenantUserInvitationSettingsDto

Whether the portal currently lets anyone be invited into it, member and guest kept apart.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**allowInvitingMembers** | **boolean** | Whether new members may be invited through the Contacts section. Switching it off stops new invitations  from being created; links already handed out keep working and members already invited stay. | [default to undefined]
**allowInvitingGuests** | **boolean** | Whether every member, and not only an administrator, may invite an outside guest into a room. It is  independent of `allowInvitingMembers`, and switching it off has the same forward-only effect. | [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { TenantUserInvitationSettingsDto } from '@onlyoffice/docspace-api-sdk';

const instance: TenantUserInvitationSettingsDto = {
    allowInvitingMembers,
    allowInvitingGuests,
};
```
