The change  takes effect for links built after it, so a page that is already open may keep pointing at the CDN until it is  reloaded. Repeating the call is harmless, because clearing an empty configuration does nothing. The caller  needs the permission to edit portal settings, which in practice means the portal owner or a DocSpace admin, on  a server installation with an unrestricted access space. Use `GET api/2.0/settings/storage/cdn` to see what is  configured now and `PUT api/2.0/settings/storage/cdn` to select a CDN again; the portal storage of the  documents is untouched by this operation and is reset with `DELETE api/2.0/settings/storage` instead.

    /**
     * Drops the third-party storage configuration of the current portal, module and saved credentials alike, and  starts an asynchronous migration of the portal data back into the built-in local storage. The portal moves  into the migrating state and stays unavailable until the transfer ends, so follow it with  `GET api/2.0/settings/storage/progress`; the call itself returns as soon as the migration has been handed to  the storage service and gives back no body. The caller needs the permission to edit portal settings, which in  practice means the portal owner or a DocSpace admin, on a server installation with an unrestricted access  space. This is a mutating and slow operation rather than a destructive one: documents are copied back rather  than deleted, but the credentials of the previous storage are gone from the settings and have to be sent again  with `PUT api/2.0/settings/storage` to switch back. Repeating the call while a migration is running starts  another one, so poll instead. Resetting the storage is also the step that makes  `POST api/2.0/settings/encryption/start` possible, since encryption only covers the local storage.

     * Selects the content delivery network that serves the static content of the portal and saves the credentials it  needs: `module` is the identifier of one of the entries of `GET api/2.0/settings/storage/cdn`, and `props`  carries that provider\'s authentication keys as name and value pairs. The provider has to be available on the  server, which the `isSet` flag of the listing tells, otherwise the request is rejected as invalid. Sending the  module the portal already uses changes nothing and returns the saved settings as they are. Any other module is  saved and the upload of the static content is handed to the storage service; the settings come back only when  that hand-over succeeds, a failure being reported as a server error. Unlike the portal storage this has no  progress operation, so there is nothing to poll: the content appears on the CDN once the service has copied  it. Only static content is affected here, never documents; for those use `PUT api/2.0/settings/storage`. The  caller needs the permission to edit portal settings, which in practice means the portal owner or a DocSpace  admin, on a server installation with an unrestricted access space. The response is the stored CDN  configuration.
