The operation takes no parameters and  overwrites whatever was configured before without asking, so read the current numbers with  `GET api/2.0/settings/security/loginsettings` first if they are worth keeping. Only the setting is reset:  sign-ins already blocked stay blocked until the block they were given runs out, and the attempt counters  running for other users are left alone. The reset is portal-wide, applies to attempts made from now on, is  recorded in the audit trail, and calling it twice changes nothing further. The restored numbers also decide  when the sign-in form starts asking for a captcha, which it does one attempt before the block. The answer is  the restored settings, with `isDefault` true. Store numbers of your own with  `PUT api/2.0/settings/security/loginsettings`.

    /**
     * Replaces the brute-force protection of the sign-in form for the whole portal: `attemptCount` failed attempts  inside a rolling window of `checkPeriod` seconds, after which the offender is blocked for `blockTime` seconds.  All three values are replaced together and each has to be between 1 and 9999, so read the current ones with  `GET api/2.0/settings/security/loginsettings` before changing only one of them; a value outside the range is  rejected as an invalid request. The caller needs the portal-settings right of a DocSpace administrator,  otherwise the call is refused. Failed attempts are counted per user name and client address, so one member\'s  lockout leaves the rest of the portal signing in normally, and a blocked pair is refused even once the  password is finally correct. The new numbers apply to attempts made from now on and leave counters and blocks  already running as they are. The change is recorded in the audit trail, and the answer is the stored settings  with the flag that says whether they still match the shipped defaults.
