It is the complete configuration  rather than a patch - fields left out are stored empty - so start from `GET api/2.0/settings/ssov2` or  `GET api/2.0/settings/ssov2/default` and send back a changed copy. The identity provider entity ID and  sign-in URL are required, the sign-in and sign-out URLs have to be absolute `http` or `https` addresses, and  the attribute mapping has to name the first name, last name and email fields; the values each SAML field  accepts are listed by `GET api/2.0/settings/ssov2/constants`. An empty string, or a string that carries no  configuration object, is refused with 400.
